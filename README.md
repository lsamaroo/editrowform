# editrowform
I wanted to be able to treat each row of a table as a cohesive form item (without me manually building the form) that I could edit and send to the server but I couldn't find anything out there fitting what I had in mind.  So now I'm working on the editrowform plugin:

"A jquery plugin which allows you to edit each row of a table inline as a comprehensive form complete with a save and cancel button."


Usage:
$( "#myTable" ).editrowform();
