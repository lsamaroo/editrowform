v1.3.3 (2015-11-22)
-------------------
- Clicking enter on the form now does the same thing as hitting the save button.



v1.3.2 (2015-05-23)
-------------------
- Add event to reposition the pop-up when the window resizes.
- Replaced the cloneExisting argument from addRow in favor rowTemplate argument.  The rowTemplate argument is an actual tr dom, string or function to create a row.
However for backward compatibility you can still pass in true/false for old behavior.



v1.3.1 (2015-05-11)
-------------------
- If a name isn't given in the column option but an id is, then it will use the id as the name as well.
- Add a defaultValue option to the column object to set the initial value of the input when it is created.


v1.3.0 (2015-05-06)
-------------------
- I realized I was using the semver incorrectly.  I was not resetting the patch level version
when upgrading the minor version.  Going forward the versions will be numbered correctly.
- Add a hook to allow validating the input for a column by specifying a validate function.
- Fix issue with undefined variable "input" in the getInputValue function.
- Integrated gulp into the project in order to run common task.
- Going forward there will be a minified version of the js and css files available.
- expose the form object created by this plugin via getForm

v1.2.10 (2015-03-25)
-------------------
- Add to bower.


v1.2.9 (2015-03-24)
-------------------
- new property added "focusOnInput".
- Originally when cloning a row via addRow it would blank out the cell values 
including those with ignore set to true.  In this version ignored columns will be respected 
and cloned as is.
- updated to generate a somewhat unique-ish id if none is given to the plugin and table doesn't
have an id either.


v1.2.8 (2015-03-23)
-------------------
- AMD compatible and add  test to demonstrate using with require.js
- Add bower.json to publish to bower.
- Add .npmignore to ignore unnecessary files in download.
- Add .gitignore
- Fixed a bug introduced by adding the hideOnBlur feature.  Clicking on an external element
which called show would not work because hideOnBlur would immediatly hide the form.


v1.2.7 (2015-03-22)
-------------------
- Add new option hideOnBlur


v1.2.6 (2015-03-22)
-------------------
- Figuring out the position to display the form based on the document instead of the parent element.
- Made some minor css changes.

v1.2.5 (2015-03-20)
-------------------
-- Add a onHide callback handler and an example demonstrating it.
- Expose the save function as public function.  This will allow you to programmatically call
save.  For instance you can hide the plugin's button bar using css and create your own save and cancel buttons.
- Removed the event object from onSave and onCancel.  If you are overriding this function, this will break your code.
This was done to allow exposing save as a public function.


v1.2.4 (2015-03-20)
-------------------
- add optional "cloneExisting" argument to addRow function.  Defaults to true.  
Set to false to have the plugin create a brand new row instead of cloning from the table.
- add new option "saveButtonTimeout" to allow you to specify if you want the save button to disable for a period of time
when the button is clicked.  E.g. to prevent multiple clicks.
- add new option "cancelButtonTimeout.  Same as saveButtonTimeout but for the cancel button.
- updated the ajax example in the test directory to use the new option.

v1.2.3 (2015-03-19)
-------------------
- onAddRow and onDelete were incorrectly receiving a event object.  Remove the argument.
- Updated the documentation in the source code.

v1.2.2 (2015-03-19)
-------------------
- Add new function setRowValues which allows you to manually set the row values.  Takes an array of values.
- Added check for valid row index on function that take in a row index as an argument.


v1.1.2 (2015-03-18)
-------------------
- Add this changelog.txt to start tracking changes.


v1.1.1 (2015-03-18)
-------------------
- Add a new "ignore" option.  Unlike the disable option ignore when true will simply not render the input.
- Add new functions addRow and deleteRow to add and delete rows from the table.
- Fixed the destroy function.  It wasn't correctly cleaning up the DOM.


v1.0.1 (2015-03-17)
-------------------
- Add a header argument to all the callback handlers.
