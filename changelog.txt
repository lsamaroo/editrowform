v1.2.8 (2015-03-23)
-------------------
- AMD compatible and add  test to demonstrate using with require.js
- Add bower.json to publish to bower.
- Add .npmignore to ignore unnecessary files in download.
- Add .gitignore
- Fixed a bug introduced by adding the hideOnBlur feature.  Clicking on an external element
which called show would not work because hideOnBlur would immediatly hide the form.


v1.2.7 (2015-03-22)
-------------------
- Add new option hideOnBlur


v1.2.6 (2015-03-22)
-------------------
- Figuring out the position to display the form based on the document instead of the parent element.
- Made some minor css changes.

v1.2.5 (2015-03-20)
-------------------
-- Add a onHide callback handler and an example demonstrating it.
- Expose the save function as public function.  This will allow you to programmatically call
save.  For instance you can hide the plugin's button bar using css and create your own save and cancel buttons.
- Removed the event object from onSave and onCancel.  If you are overriding this function, this will break your code.
This was done to allow exposing save as a public function.


v1.2.4 (2015-03-20)
-------------------
- add optional "cloneExisting" argument to addRow function.  Defaults to true.  
Set to false to have the plugin create a brand new row instead of cloning from the table.
- add new option "saveButtonTimeout" to allow you to specify if you want the save button to disable for a period of time
when the button is clicked.  E.g. to prevent multiple clicks.
- add new option "cancelButtonTimeout.  Same as saveButtonTimeout but for the cancel button.
- updated the ajax example in the test directory to use the new option.

v1.2.3 (2015-03-19)
-------------------
- onAddRow and onDelete were incorrectly receiving a event object.  Remove the argument.
- Updated the documentation in the source code.

v1.2.2 (2015-03-19)
-------------------
